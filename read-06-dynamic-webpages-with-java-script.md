Different combinations of 0's and 1's send signals to circuit boards to add binary code together to send information to more hardware! I got a little lost after that, but I really can't believe how amazing computers are.

## Variables in JavaScript

Variable: A changeable label for information/data. 

In JavaScript, we give values to variables to be defined later when we reference in other lines of JavaScript code. Kind of like how we give letters a numeric value to help us solve equations in algebra.

**The 3 Variables of JavaScript are:**

## Input and Output in JavaScript

For example, let's say name = Camilla. Name is my variable, Camilla is my value.

Now, if we want
