## HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions



**Hyperlinks in HTML**

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
  - An "a" element
2. The "href" attribute contains what information?
  - The web address we want to link to direct to
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
  - Use clear link wording that tells the readers exactly what they can expect if they click the link
  - Make sure to include the link wording in regular text, so those using screen readers will also get relevant info about the link
  - Clear link wording is also helpfulf or SEO

**CSS Layout**

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
  - The way that elements are layed out by default
2. What are a few differences between "block-level" and "inline" elements?
  - Display: block; - makes the element's content fill all available inline space of the parent element containing it and can be adjusted in size 
  - Display: inline; - can't set width or height, just sits inside the content of block level elements. Use display: inline-block; to control the size 
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
  - Static positioning
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
  - position: absolute;
  - An absolutely positioned element sits on its own layers separate from the normal document flow.
  - This is helpful because we can create isolated User Interface features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example:
  - Popup information boxes
  - Control menus
  - Rollover panels
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
  - Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor and fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport
  - This helps you create User Interface items that are fixed in place, like persistent navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls

**JS Functions (Reusable Blocks of Code**

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
  - Declaration: Creating the function, this is the first step and can be found at the beginning of a function
  - Invocation: Calling the function to run, this happens at the end, outside of the created function
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  - Parameters: The names listed in the function's definition
  - Arguments: The real values passed to the function
  - Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied

**Reasons for Pair Programming**
Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

1. Learning from fellow students

I've noticed in my short time in 201, that when I work with several of my classmates, we all have different ways of doing the same thing. Seeing all of us think in ways that the other one doesn't is inspiring and helps me to open my mind to possibilities. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and feel like there has to be one right way to do things, and while I know there are best practices, I think this is the perfect time for me to learn through trial and error and collaboration. I've also had classmates explain things to me in ways I never would have thought of, but they've helped me understand concepts that I struggle with.

2. Job interview readiness

I had no idea that job interview processes could involve pair programming, but it makes so much sense. I think the more I practice pair programming, the more natural it will feel in the job interview process, and working with future colleagues to work together on code challenges. Improving my ability to work well and efficiently with a partner will help me big time!


## Things I Want to Know More About

I'm interested in learning more about CSS layout. I really love design and have so many fun ideas, but not enough knowledge to execute them. I'm interested in multiple column layout and float, I'm going to try them out on my about me page this week!
