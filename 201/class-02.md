## HTML Fundamentals

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
  - By giving semantic value/meaning to our HTML, the browser will know how to display the elements correctly. It also helps the dev make sense of the code easier.
 
2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML? **6**

3. What are some uses for the sup and sub elements?
`- Sup is superscript 
 - Sub is subscript

You might use these elements for dates, math, chemistry, etc.
 
4. When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term? **title**
  
## CSS Fundamentals

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
  - External style sheet (.css)
  - Internal style sheet (style tags)
  - Inline styles (style attributes)
  
2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?
  - It's not efficient and it makes the code harder to read because it meshes with the HTML
  
```
     h2 {
     color: black;
     padding: 5px;
   }
```

**Anatomy of code block above:**
- The representating selector is h2
- The components that are CSS declarations are color and padding

### Conditionals

1. An if statement checks a **condition** and if it evaluates to **true**, then the code block will execute.
  -
2. What is the use of an else if?
  - If we want our code to make decisions or have a different output depending on the input, we can use conditionals like else if.
  
3. List 3 different types of comparison operators
  - Greater or lesser than > <
  - Greater than or equal to, lesser than or equal to >= <=
  - Identical or not identical to === !=
