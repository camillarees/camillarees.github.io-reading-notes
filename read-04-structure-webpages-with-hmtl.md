# Structure Web Pages with HTML

## Wireframe and Design

### High-level Step-by-Step Guide to Make a New Site

**1. Research**

Understand audience through:
- User research
- Detailing requirements
- Creating user personas and defining use cases
- Running an analysis of competitors
- UX trends and best practises
- Reviewing internal design guidelines

**2. Prepare research for quick reference**

- Keep a quick reference of:
- Business and user goals,
- Your personas
- Use cases

**3. Map out user flow**

Plan ahead for the flow the user with follow (where they come from and where they will end up) 

**Information Architecture**

Allows users to be self-sufficient through streamlined information and clear, guiding instructions

**4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate**

Outline the basics (skeleton of desighn)

**Consider:**
- How can you organize the content to support your users’ goals?
- Which information/messages should be most prominent?
- What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
- What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
- Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

**5. Add some detail and get testing**

Add informational details to prepare wireframe for its upgrade

**Consider:**
1. Usability conventions
2. Simple, instructional wording
3. Trust-building elements: 
  - What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would be the best place to put these elements?

**6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes**

Develop high-fidelity prototypes using Proto.io, Adobe XD,  Framer, Sketch or Figma 

## Semantics

Meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" 

### How are these semantics elements common to most web pages?

Semantic elements breath life into code. They exist for both the coder and user, but mostly the coder. They help us define and organize code as simply as possible. They help us understand what piece of code is doing what for the web page.

**Benefits of writing semantic markup:**
- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
- Easier to find meaningful code
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

**Consider:**
1. "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" 
  - Is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?
  - Is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?
  - Is it a figure or image that needs a caption?
  - Should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?

**Basic Semantic Elements**

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
