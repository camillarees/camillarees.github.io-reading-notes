# Choosing a Text Editor - Notes Outline

## What is a Text Editor?

### Important features to consider when selecting a text editor

1. Code completion: this predicts text and offers autofill suggestions, including catching mistakes like closing tag
2. Syntax Highlighting: colorizes text to distinguish attributes, elements and copy.
3. Themes: A variety of themes reduces eye strain and fatigue
4. Extensions: Is there a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them? 
5. What are your must-haves?
