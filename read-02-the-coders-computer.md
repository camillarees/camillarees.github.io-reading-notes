# Choosing a Text Editor - Notes Outline

## What is a Text Editor?

- A text editor is pretty self-explanatory. It allows you to write and edit/manage text, particularly website content.
- It can either be software or online

### Important features to consider when selecting a text editor
1. Code completion
2. Syntax
3. Highlighting
4. Themes 
  - Does the text editor have a variety of themes to reduce eye strain and
fatigue? 
5. Extensions
  - Is there a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. 
6. What are your must-haves?

A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
Also, some code completion includes the closing of tags when you
open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or the�
closing of quotation marks when you open them, thus making sure
you’re always writing your code.

### Why Third Party Options are Better than the text editors that come with your computer
- They almost always have more of the helpful features listed above

#### Emmet

Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more
efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that
can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or
Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.
Another feature you should definitely look into is called syntax
highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes
are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color
than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.

#### NotePad++
#### TextWrangler/BB Edit
#### Visual Studio Code
#### Atom
#### Brackets
#### Sublime Text


## What is an IDE?
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If
you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed
that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all
in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one
software package.
While you might not be ready, or have the need to use a compiler, or
a debugger when you’re just starting out in web development, you’ll
get to see how an IDE operates in your text editing software. When
you’re ready to use an IDE, you’ll be more confident in how to use it
because you’ll already had some experience with it by using your text
editor.
