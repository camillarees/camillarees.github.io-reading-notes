## **A Growth Mindset in My Own Words** ðŸ¦‹

*A growth mindset is the idea that there is no end to progress. All successes and failures are opportunities to learn, think outside the box, and try a new way.*

- Remember to trust the process. Baby steps are still steps.
- Remember to open up your mind. You can't do the same thing over and over and expect different results.
- Remember that you can ask for help. You are not alone!

>"It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop." - Confucius
